An HTML email design

I completed this email design before I realized that the instructions were specifically to code the design specified in the challenge. Here are the steps I took to create this email.

<ol>
<li>Why? What is the purpose of this email design?</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Demonstrate familiarity with a variety of HTML email coding techniques</li>
    <li>Demonstrate a sense of design based on the example email</li>
    <li>Have fun - create something that others will enjoy</li>
  </ul>
<li>Create rough <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chuabacca/code-challenge/master/Star%20Wars%20email%20mockup.png" target="_blank">wireframe</a> to plan the main segments of the email.</li>
<li>Code and test the email in stages - header, section one, section two, etc.</li>
<li>Test and address client-specific issues</li>
<li>Confirm final tests pass</li>
<li>Upload project to GitHub</li>
</ol>

## unresolved issues
I was unable to find a solution for these issues.
<ol>
<li>Inconsistent line spacing in Outlook for "The Dark Side" text.</li>
<li>Positioning quirks in footer text for Outlook.</li>
</ol>
Proposed workarounds if further refinement is undertaken
<ol>
<li>Place "The" on the line above and display text "Dark Side" at full line height.</li>
<li>Move footer text below logo and allow it to span the whole width so that positioning quirks will not cause the logo and text to be misaligned.</li>
</ol>
