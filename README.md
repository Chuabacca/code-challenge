#### An HTML email design

This project is a custom designed HTML email that features modular table segments and multiple column responsive design segments, an element that appears to break the table structure, and progressive enhancement with an animated gif and text shadow for clients that support them.

#### Design Process
<ol>
<li>Why? What is the purpose of this email design?</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Demonstrate familiarity with a variety of HTML email coding techniques</li>
    <li>Demonstrate a sense of design based on the example email</li>
    <li>Have fun - create something that others will enjoy</li>
  </ul>
<li>Create rough <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chuabacca/code-challenge/master/Star%20Wars%20email%20mockup.png" target="_blank">wireframe</a> to plan the main segments of the email.</li>
<li>Code and test the email in stages - header, section one, section two, etc.</li>
<li>Test and address client-specific issues</li>
<li>Confirm final tests pass</li>
<li>Upload project to GitHub</li>
</ol>

#### Unresolved Issues
I was unable to find a solution for these issues.
<ol>
<li>Inconsistent line spacing in Outlook for "The Dark Side" text.</li>
<li>Positioning quirks in footer text for Outlook.</li>
</ol>
Proposed workarounds if further refinement is undertaken
<ol>
<li>Place "The" on the line above and display text "Dark Side" at full line height.</li>
<li>Move footer text below logo and allow it to span the whole width so that positioning quirks will not cause the logo and text to be misaligned.</li>
</ol>
